# asking people "what is the best way to build a community online?"


##### Beaei

the best way to create on online community is to work towards a goal or take action together

##### rise

The community is not better than the founder.

make sure the founders belive in the goal

have boundaries and rules

need:
- a goal or theme.
- mods that can exercise good jugdement.
- figuring out the age rages (g, pg, pg-13, r, x) for the server.

common mistakes:
    - not given the community has aim
    - not figuring out the age rages (g, pg, pg-13, r, x)

main take away

have *rule, bounties, goals(mission statment), age, safty*
