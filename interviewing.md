the best way to create on online community is to work towards a goal or take action together

community are not better than the founder.

make sure the founders belive in the goal

have boundaries and rules

need a goal or theme.

good mods the had good jugdement

*rule, bounties, goals(mission statment), age, safty*


mistakes

        - figure out the age rages (g, pg, pg-13, r, x)
